Kepler Visualizer
=================

Kepler Visualizer aims to visualize the data gathered by Kepler mission in 
multiple presentation forms. It uses Arduino to visualize Kepler data and 
present it in an audio-visual form (LED lights and complementing sound) to 
aid us to visualize the changing star intensity.

The objective is to enable school children understand how kepler data is 
used to find extrasolar planets.
